<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged LEAP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new LEAPs. Note that a LEAP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your LEAP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `leap-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Simply describe the outcome the proposed changes intend to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.-->
This LEAP proposes to establish incentives for GrantsDAO.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change, the abstract should clearly describe the proposed change. This is what *will* be done if the LEAP is implemented, not *why* it should be done or *how* it will be done. If the LEAP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".-->
GrantsDAO is to receive a monthly stipend equal to that of Lyra's Council.

##  Motivation
<!--This is the problem statement. This is the *why* of the LEAP. It should clearly explain *why* the current state of the protocol is inadequate. It is critical that you explain *why* the change is needed, if the LEAP proposes changing how something is calculated, you must address *why* the current calculation is inaccurate or wrong. This is not the place to describe how the LEAP will address the issue!-->
Setting an expectation of compensation for GrantsDAO allows Lyra to attract and maintain the best talent possible.

## Specification

<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
<!--This is a high level overview of *how* the LEAP will solve the problem. The overview should clearly describe how the new feature will be implemented.-->
This LEAP aims to establish an incentives structure for Lyra’s GrantsDAO.

### Rationale
LEAP - 17 established Lyra’s GrantsDAO and as an incentivized role that will be paid a monthly discretionary stipend by the LyraDAO.
After the first epoch of GrantsDAO, the workload has become clear. We are now able to formalize appropriate compenation for GrantsDAO going forward.

### Technical Specification
This LEAP sets the compensation for the GrantsDAO as equal to that of Council.

### Configurable Values
<!--Please list all values configurable under this implementation.-->
GrantsDAO members will receive the following each month:
5000 LYRA
$2000 worth of LYRA, using the open price on coingecko on the first of each month. If this price is less than $0.05, the DAO may pay council members in USDC.
